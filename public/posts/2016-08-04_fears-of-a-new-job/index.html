I did feel a bit better after talking to my boss and he mentioned I had been doing great work on getting a feature implemented. As well, while listening to the Talk Python to Me podcast. They had mentioned that even after being on the job for 3 months in most projects you still would be new and not know good portions of the code base.\nMain thing I’m trying to get at for new developers (like me) is, it’s okay. Its a new job and I’m sure you are doing a great job. Even if you feel like you should have caught that typo 30 minutes ago and want to pull your hair out. As long as your learning from all the ups and downs you’ll be okay.\nAs well you might not be in the same boat as me. I am working my first job remotely so I don’t have day to day interaction with developers and 60%-70% of my communication is done via text, with me on a timezone difference of 3–6 hours depending on who I need to talk to.\nI’ll end on this note though, I’m so happy to be in a position that I am learning everyday, doing what I love.
