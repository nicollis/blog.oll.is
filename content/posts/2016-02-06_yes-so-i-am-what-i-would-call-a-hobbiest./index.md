Yes, so I am what I would call a hobbiest. I have worked the past 5 years “Learning to program” without any real discipline. Due to this is skipped all of the “challenges” except for the bootstrap ones. However, I still feel their quoted time is horribly off. I have seen a lot of other post from people said they went from 0 to done in under 1000 hours. way under what they quote.
