March is upon us and I just finished up One Month Rails. While I did enjoy the class I have to say even coming from someone who is new to Rails it went insanely slow at the beginning allowing me to finish the whole course in about a week. However, I will say there explanation and run through of a MVC framework was amazing. I have worked in them before but feel I have a better understanding now than I ever had in the past.

While I still feel $45 is completely overpriced for the content, I was happy I got a coupon to take the course for a dollar. I could still see the course being worth $45 though if you are completely new to backend web programming as they do break down some concepts well enough that it should be a good start before going with more advanced material.

So what’s the plans for March? I’ve take the first few days of this week off for a break and to deal with the loss of our oldest dog. However, I’ll be starting up with Michael Hartl’s Rails Tutorial for more of an in depth look at rails and away from all the generated code and scaffolding found in One Month Rails.

I’m excited to get both into this new month of rails programing and get yet another project for the [portfolio that is now live!](http://ollis.me)

As for meetups this month it is always important to stay connected. We have the Indy.rb meetup this week, and later this month the Bloomington.rb meetup. Hopefully I’ll get to attend the local Open Indy meetup where we hope to continue some of the work from the hackathon. However, with spring break looming over next week we will have to see if the local meetup groups take a hiatus like the rest of the town.

As always thanks for reading, and follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nic_ollis) for more daily updates and post on my journey from Senior IT Admin to Junior Developer. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments below, and don’t forget it’s always a good time to start to #LearnToCode
