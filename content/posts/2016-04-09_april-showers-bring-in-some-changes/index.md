We are officially into april now I figured I would do my monthly wrap up and planning blog. March was an okayish month. If you follow along you would noticed I only ended up posting 3 times last month. While I am working on studying a lot I have started looking at developer jobs. With this I’m not posting too much about the places or the journey but it has shaped a bit about what I will be doing this month.

First off to catch up on what was done last month. I have started doing some live streaming although disorganized it’s a start. During the stream I was working on adding a new feature to a gem rubocop-git. That is currently pending via pull request but is available on [my page](https://github.com/nicollis/rubocop-git). I have also continued on the rails tutorial but have chosen not to live stream that due to the content and with the reading, it’s not a good stream subject.

For the month of april I’ll be switching gears at least for the next few weeks and studying PHP and the Craft CSM. I’m currently working on an opportunity but they use PHP and Craft as their development platform. Once we wrap that up in a few weeks I’m hoping to finish up the Rails tutorial later this month and start working on a new open sourced project I’m pretty excited about and will be live streaming a good amount of its creation.

As always thanks for reading, and follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nic_ollis) for more daily updates, live stream alerts, and post on my journey from Senior IT Admin to Junior Developer. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments below, and don’t forget it’s always a good time to start to #LearnToCode
