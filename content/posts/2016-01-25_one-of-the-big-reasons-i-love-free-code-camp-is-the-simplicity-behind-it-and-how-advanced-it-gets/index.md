One of the big reasons I love Free Code Camp is the simplicity behind it, and how advanced it gets when you get into projects. While I was sad to see the terminology go, I was happy to see how quickly changes were made when the community saw the new site in put in input on how to improve. I hear Ruby has the best community out there of any language. However, I wonder if that because they haven’t stumbled on the community at [Free Code Camp](https://medium.com/u/8b318225c16a).
