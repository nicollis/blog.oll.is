If you are someone who loves to cook, you know how fun it can be to experiment with different recipes and ingredients. But what if you could take your culinary skills to the next level with a little help from AI? That is precisely what I did when I decided to make banana bread with the assistance of ChatGPT.

For those who do not know, ChatGPT is an AI model created by OpenAI that generates text based on prompts provided by users. It has been trained on a massive dataset of text, allowing it to generate responses that are often impressively human-like. While ChatGPT has many uses, I was curious to see how it could help me come up with a banana bread recipe and make edits to that recipe as needed.

## Finding the Banana Bread Recipe

To get started, I input my initial request for a banana bread recipe into ChatGPT. I was impressed by the speed of the response, as well as the easy and detail of the recipe.

One of the things I appreciated about ChatGPT was that it allowed me to easily modify the recipe to suit my needs. For example, I wanted to use vanilla beans instead of vanilla extract, so I asked ChatGPT how I would make this substitution. It was able to provide me with clear instructions on how to use the beans, and the recipe steps updated automatically to reflect this change.

## Editing the Recipe with ChatGPT

Another way that ChatGPT helped me was by allowing me to make other edits to the recipe as needed. For example, I did not have a loaf pan available, so I decided to use the smallest pan I had, an 8×8 pan. ChatGPT was able to update the cooking time and temperature to support my new pan size, and it even informed me of how the new pan size would affect the texture of the bread. This kind of personalized assistance really helped me feel more confident in my ability to make the recipe successfully. As well-informed me the benefits/cost of using different size pans.

## Pairing Sides with Banana Bread

Once I had my banana bread recipe sorted out, I decided to see if ChatGPT could help me come up with some side dishes to serve alongside it. To my delight, it was able to generate a list of options that would pair well with the bread. I was particularly pleased with the healthy options that it presented, as I am continually investigating how to eat more nutritious foods.

## Converting Recipe to Weights

Finally, ChatGPT was capable of converting the recipe to weights for me, which was a huge help. By using a single bowl and a scale to measure my ingredients, I was able to save on dishes and streamline the preparation process. This might seem like a small thing, but it really did make a difference in terms of how smoothly everything went.

## Conclusion

All in all, I was extremely impressed with how well ChatGPT could assist me in making banana bread. Not only was it able to help me find a recipe, but it also allowed me to make various edits to that recipe based on my needs and preferences. All in a quick chat that only took a minute or two. The fact that it was able to generate a list of side dishes and convert the recipe to weights was just icing on the cake (or should I say, frosting on the banana bread!). If you are someone who loves to cook and is curious about the ways that AI can enhance your kitchen experience, I highly recommend giving ChatGPT a try. You might be surprised at just how helpful it can be! I know my daughter was thankful for its help and being able to come home to fresh banana bread.

## Recommended sides (verbatim from ChatGPT):
Banana bread is delicious on its own, but it also pairs well with a variety of different foods and beverages. Here are some ideas for what to serve with banana bread:

- Butter or cream cheese: A spread of butter or cream cheese can add richness and a bit of tang to the bread.
- Fresh fruit: Sliced bananas, strawberries, or blueberries can be a great compliment to the sweetness of the banana bread.
- Nuts: Chopped walnuts, pecans, or almonds can add crunch and texture to the bread.
- Yogurt: A dollop of plain or vanilla-flavored yogurt can add a creamy, tangy contrast to the bread.
- Coffee or tea: A cup of hot coffee or tea can help to balance out the sweetness of the bread and enhance the flavors.
- Ice cream: A scoop of vanilla or caramel ice cream can be a decadent dessert option to serve with banana bread.

These are just a few ideas to get you started, but please don't hesitate to experiment and find your own favorite pairings!
