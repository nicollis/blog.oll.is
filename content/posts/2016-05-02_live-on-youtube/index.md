Program Practical is now on youtube. This month I am moving to a bi-media format with blog post going to start coming out weekly on Program Practical, as well weekly video post on YouTube.

These post will cover a range of programming topics, from progress updates, coding tutorials, and coding news. I will be currently be focused more on Ruby and Rails, but might jump into C++, Python, and other languages depending on my current project or topic request.

The current videos in the pipeline include a background on my coding past, some code problem solving in C++, and one I’m shooting tonight on making Linked List in Ruby.

As always thanks for reading, and follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nic_ollis) for more daily updates, live stream alerts, and post on my journey from Senior IT Admin to Junior Developer.
