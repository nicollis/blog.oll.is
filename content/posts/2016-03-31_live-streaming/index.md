It’s been a bit between post. With the holidays things tend to get busy with my family. I have started live streaming some coding. I’m hoping to make it a more regular thing, although I’m trying to work it into a fixed point on in my week.

After editing some of the dead points of the live stream I plan to release the video’s on youtube. The current live stream is following me along as I’m adding a new feature to the open sourced project rubocop-git. Currently on the stream it’s me and my friend Alex, who is just getting into program. While he is not busy with work he is helping to ask questions that I might not think about bringing up for newer programmers.

For the future I plan to do some more live streams on the other open sourced projects I’m working on and how to contribute to open sourced projects. I am also planning a series this summer when bash comes to windows to see how windows stacks up for Ruby and Ruby on Rails development.

For anyone that missed the news yesterday. Windows will be releasing an “anniversary update” or Windows 10.1 this summer. They have partnered with Canonical to bring “a full ubuntu image” into windows as a subsystem. Allowing you to asses bash in a full linux like environment. This should allow for file I/O and threading to happen the same way linux implements it. It’s my hope (and windows) that this will bring development back to windows for many projects and libraries that have no, or broken support for windows.

The live streaming will be happening over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/nicgillespie) as well I’m hoping to have last night’s stream live soon. It’s a little rough but it’s a start.

As always thanks for reading, and follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nic_ollis) for more daily updates, live stream alerts, and post on my journey from Senior IT Admin to Junior Developer. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments below, and don’t forget it’s always a good time to start to #LearnToCode
